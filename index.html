            Wackerbarth is a photographic and video artist based in DÃ¼sseldorf.
            The Red Couch projects have been a key focal point of his life's
            work. Wackerbarth has been portraying people from all walks of life
            in their living environment on his Red Couch since 1979. He traveled
            to countries from the most important cultural areas of the world:
            Europe, Russia, China, Africa, North and South America.
          </p>
          <p>
            His goal was and is (the work is not yet completed) a portrait work,
            to record a new "Family of Mankind" for future generations. As such,
            the Red Couch Project is conceptual art about a world stage of
            humanity in the 20th/21st century.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Red Couch functions as a "safe place" where people are protected
            and encouraged to raise their voices, tell their stories and leave a
            trace of their existence .
          </p>
          <p>Only one couch is on the road at any given time.</p>
          <p>
            Three sofas have been lost. One fell into the Pacific Ocean during a
            daring ship manoeuvre, one was destroyed by fire during a photo
            shoot with firemen and one was disposed of at a museum by workers
            who mistook it for junk. The currently reigning couch has been in
            service since 1996 and is the one on which most protagonists have
            sat down. From time to time the sofa covers are renewed. A complete
            restoration was necessary twice, after lions and polar bears had
            ruined it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Red Couch is a work in progress and a never-ending story that
            will only come to an end when Wackerbarth passes away
